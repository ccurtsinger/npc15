      NPC'2015 provides a forum for bold and innovative ideas.  Big Data, Internet of Things, Smartphones, Youtube, Globally Distributed Databases, Social Networks and more are driving network and parallel computing in new directions.  Security and privacy have new importance after break-ins at major retailers and banks, Stuxnet, and the revelations of Edward Snowden. What are the implications for network and parallel computing?
    </p>

    <p>
      NPC seeks early stage work with the potential for major changes in network and parallel computing.  Although quantitative assessment is valuable, and NPC welcomes such papers, NPC places yet more value on bold ideas, even if all of the details and corner cases are not yet resolved, or the ideas fully implemented.
    </p>

    <p>
      NPC 2015 welcomes original submissions in a range of areas, including but not limited to:
    </p>

      NPC is in its 12th year and previous conferences have attracted high quality papers and wide international participation.  Detailed submission instructions will be posted on the NPC 2015 website.  As in previous years, we are working to publish top papers from NPC 2015 in a special issue of the International Journal of Parallel Programming (SCI indexed).  Additional details are on the website.  Other venues are also being explored.
