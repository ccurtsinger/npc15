                                NPC 2015
The 12th IFIP International Conference on Network and Parallel Computing 
                (SCI / EI indexed proceedings in progress)
                       http://npc15.cs.umass.edu

           September 17-19, 2015              New York, New York

SPONSOR:         IFIP
IN-COOPERATION:  ACM SIGMICRO

===========================================================================
NPC'2015 provides a forum for bold and innovative ideas.  Big Data, Internet
of Things, Smartphones, Youtube, Globally Distributed Databases, Social
Networks and more are driving network and parallel computing in new
directions.  Security and privacy have new importance after break-ins at
major retailers and banks, Stuxnet, and the revelations of Edward Snowden.
What are the implications for network and parallel computing?

NPC especially seeks early stage work with the potential for major
changes in network and parallel computing.  Although quantitative
assessment is valuable, and NPC welcomes such papers, NPC places yet
more value on bold ideas, even if all of the details and corner cases
are not yet resolved, or the ideas fully implemented.

NPC 2015 welcomes original submissions in a range of areas, including but not
limited to:

 o In-Memory computing
 o Applications of parallel and distributed computing.
 o Systems, networks, and architectures for high end computing.
 o Parallel and multi-core issues and opportunities.
 o Big data intelligence.
 o Virtualization of machines, networks, and storage.
 o Programming languages and environments.
 o I/O, file systems, and data management.
 o Resource management, scheduling, and load-balancing.
 o Performance modeling, simulation, and prediction.
 o Fault tolerance, reliability and availability.

PC is in its 12th year and previous conferences have attracted high quality
papers and wide international participation.

As in previous years, we will publish top papers from NPC 2015 in a special
issue of the International Journal of Parallel Programming (SCI indexed).
Additional details are on the NPC'2015 website above.
