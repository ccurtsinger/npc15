## Publication Model

The NPC’2015 Organizing committee has arranged to publish the top-ranked papers submitted to NPC’2015 in a special issue of the SCI-indexed, International Journal of Parallel Programming (IJPP).
All papers submitted to NPC’2015 will use the [EasyChair submission system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=npc20150). Submissions will undergo rigorous review to select the highest quality original work. 
Authors of top-ranked papers selected for publication in IJPP will will be asked to revise their papers according to reviewer comments.  Authors of papers accepted for publication in IJPP will present their work in a "Best Papers" session of NPC’2015.  Other accepted papers will be published in conference proceedings by LNCS.
